   **   Original header text:
   ** -------------------------------------------------------------
   **  File containing routines to convert a buffer
   **  of bytes to/from RFC 1113 printable encoding format.
   **
   **  This technique is similar to the familiar Unix uuencode
   **  format in that it maps 6 binary bits to one ASCII
   **  character (or more aptly, 3 binary bytes to 4 ASCII
   **  characters).  However, RFC 1113 does not use the same
   **  mapping to printable characters as uuencode.

/*--- function HTUU_encode -----------------------------------------------
 *
 *   Encode a single line of binary data to a standard format that
 *   uses only printing ASCII characters (but takes up 33% more bytes).
 *
 *    Entry    bufin      points to a buffer of bytes.
 *             nbytes     is the number of bytes in that buffer.
 *                        This cannot be more than 48.
 *             bufcoded   points to an output buffer.  Be sure that this
 *                        can hold at least 1 + 4*(nbytes+2)/3 characters.
 *             outbufsize is the maximum number of bytes that
 *                        can fit in bufcoded.
 *
 *    Exit     bufcoded   contains the coded line.  The first 4*(nbytes+2)/3
 *                        bytes contain printing ASCII characters representing
 *                        those binary bytes. This may include one or two '='
 *                        characters used as padding at the end.  The last
 *                        byte is a zero byte.
 *
 *             Returns the number of ASCII characters in bufcoded or -1 in
 *                     the case of overflow.
