// stdafx.h : include file for standard system include files,
//      or project specific include files that are used frequently,
//      but are changed infrequently

// Since there are multiple directories that need to have stdafx.h, we put all
// the stuff in stdafx_common.h to have the actual code in only one place.

#include "stdafx_common.h"
