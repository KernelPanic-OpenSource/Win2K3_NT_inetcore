WHAT'S NEW FOR IEAK 6
=======================

IEAK 6 includes:

- User Rights Deployment. Corporate Administrators can now deploy
  Internet Explorer directly to users who do not have Administrator-
  level access. Using tools such as SMS to initiate the install
  with Administrator privileges, users can log on after the system 
  restarts and complete the setup process without using scripts or 
  multiple reboots.

- More Robust Custom Component Installation. You can now specify 
  when a custom component gets installed and that it installs only 
  if the Internet Explorer installation was successful.

- SMS Status Reporting. Packages that are configured for SMS 
  deployment can now report the status of installation to the 
  SMS Server.

- Desktop Management. Desktop and Quick Launch shortcuts such as 
  Outlook Express, "View Channels," and "Connect to the Internet" 
  can now be eliminated from your users' desktops to reduce clutter 
  and reduce support incidents.

For a detailed list of new features and improvements, see the 
"What's New" section in the IEAK Help.

  NOTE: The customizations installed by the IEAK during Internet 
        Explorer Setup will always overwrite previous customizations. 
        Even if no Internet Explorer components need to be installed, 
        your customizations overwrite the old installation. Previous 
        options, including the branding version number and 
        configuration identifier, are no longer necessary.


GENERAL SETUP REQUIREMENTS
==========================

Before you can use the IEAK, you must install Internet Explorer 6.

Before starting the Internet Explorer Customization Wizard, calculate
the amount of disk space required for the components that you want to
install:

- Depending on the number of components you download, you will need
  up to 100 MB of disk space.

- For every custom package you generate and every media type you 
  select, you need additional disk space equal to the size of the 
  package for each media type. You also need temporary disk space to 
  create and compress each media type.

For more information on each of the Microsoft components, see the 
IEAK Help.


WHAT ELSE YOU SHOULD KNOW
=========================

You can customize and brand Internet Explorer in more ways than ever. 
The increased customization possible with IEAK 6, however, prohibits 
a certain amount of backward compatibility with the .ins files that 
store your branding information.

The .ins files that you create with IEAK 6 can brand Internet Explorer
6. They cannot brand earlier versions of Internet Explorer. However, 
you can brand Internet Explorer 6.0 with the .ins files that you 
created in IEAK 5.x.

Example 1: You use IEAK 6 to create three separate versions of 
Internet Explorer. You name the .ins files ver1.ins, ver2.ins, and 
ver3.ins. You use these files to brand your three versions of 
Internet Explorer 6.

Example 2: In the past, you created three versions of Internet 
Explorer with IEAK 5.5. You named the .ins files market1.ins, 
market2.ins, and market3.ins. You now use these previously created 
.ins files to brand your three versions of Internet Explorer 6.


KNOWN ISSUES
============

- Packages created with IEAK 4.x and earlier will not be able to 
  apply settings to Internet Explorer 6 installations.
 
- Toolbar icon customizations will show a default system icon for the 
  disabled state.

- Automatic detection does not work if you use an .ins file as the 
  Web Proxy AutoDiscovery (WPAD) data file (wpad.dat).

- According to the Help topic "Automatic Detection and Configuration
  of Browser Settings," the wpad.dat file can be a .pac, .jvs, .js, 
  or .ins automatic configuration file. This is incorrect. The browser
  does not interpret an .ins file generated by the IEAK, but instead 
  interprets only a renamed proxy automatic configuration file or a 
  .pac, .jvs, or .js file. Workaround: Set up automatic detection as 
  specified in the Help file. Specify the wpad.dat file as a 
  redirector to your .ins file.

  >>>To specify a redirection for wpad.dat in Microsoft Internet 
     Information Server (IIS):

  1. In the Microsoft Management Console (MMC), start Internet Service
       Manager.
  2. Locate the wpad.dat file (usually located at the root of the Web 
       server).
  3. Right-click the wpad.dat file, and then click Properties. On the 
       File tab, click "A redirection to a URL." Browse to the .ins 
       file, which can be located anywhere on the server.

- During Kiosk mode signup, the Internet Connection Wizard could fall
  behind the Kiosk mode window on Windows 2000 computers.

- When you import connection settings on a Windows 2000 computer, 
  only settings that can be applied to any Win32 client are imported.

- When you import connection settings on a Windows 98 computer, if 
  "Record a Log File for this Connection" is selected, the setting 
  is not imported into the package.

- The newest version of CMAK is available in Windows 2000 Server and 
  in the Windows 2000 Admin Pack. To use an older version of CMAK 
  without Windows 2000 Server, you can install IEAK 5.01 and then 
  upgrade to IEAK 6.

- If you are upgrading from IEAK 4, the IEAK 4 Start Menu link will 
  not be removed. You can remove it manually by browsing to the Start
  Menu directory and deleting the link.

- End users running Windows 2000 cannot individually customize their
  installation of the package. All Windows Update components will be 
  installed.

- If the .ins file resides on an HTTPS server, users who previously
  set "Do not save encrypted pages to disk" cannot complete signup.

- Pay careful attention to the AutoComplete feature options. 
  AutoComplete can store important or personal information in 
  various scenarios. Depending on your situation, these features 
  should be configured appropriately or turned off completely.

- When you use a previously generated .ins file in a new session of
  the Internet Explorer Customization Wizard, note that some of the
  feature settings or file paths may have changed. Errors produced 
  during package generation may be caused by this previously created 
  .ins file. To ensure that your new package is generated correctly,
  validate all settings and file paths before finishing the 
  Customization Wizard.  

- If you build a package to an existing directory using the Internet
  Explorer Customization Wizard, disabling Setup Customizations 
  through Feature Selection will delete the previously created 
  ie6sites.dat. To avoid this, do not disable Setup Customizations 
  when building to an existing directory.

- If you run the Internet Explorer Customization Wizard using 
  different roles, it is recommended that you build to different 
  directories. This will prevent any inapplicable settings from 
  being included in the custom package.

- In Microsoft Outlook Express, pre-subscribed newsgroups are 
  configured only if a news server is also specified.

- The Outlook Express junk mail filtering option, in Stage 5 of 
  the Internet Explorer Customization Wizard, has no effect on 
  the computer on which Outlook Express is currently installed.

- On Asian platforms, the Internet Explorer Customization Wizard
  may appear in a large font when the computer is first restarted.
  To resolve this issue, restart the computer again.

- The ISP File Wizard, included in the IEAK Toolkit, will install
  only on a computer that has the Visual Basic 4.0 run-time 
  components installed. It will install normally on a Windows 98 
  computer.

- If you build a package for CD-ROM distribution, the Autorun 
  program provides a link to "More Information". You can customize 
  this to display a text file. The text file must be smaller than 
  100 KB to appear correctly.

- The help topic Filetypes indicates that .pdf files are used for SMS
  deployment. However, .pdf files are not used. The file name IE5.pdf 
  is incorrect. Instead, the file IE6-sms.sms is used.

- The help topic Filetypes mentions the file IE5Setup.exe. This is
  incorrect and should read IE6Setup.exe.

- The help topic Setup Information File (.inf) Definition contains 
  two typographical errors. The information in the section "Update 
  Config.sys Sections under the subheading "Stacks item" should read:
  
  Stacks=dos-stacks-values 
  Sets the number and size of stacks in the Config.sys file. The 
  Installer compares the existing value with the proposed value and 
  always sets the stacks to the larger of the two values. For example, 
  if Config.sys contains stacks=9,218 and an .inf file contains 
  stacks=5,256, the installer sets the new value to stacks=9,218.

  legal-dos-stacks-value 
  A legal MS-DOS stacks value. 

  The first code block in the section "Optional Components section" 
  under the subheading Include should read:

  [Optional Components]
  InstallMyToys
  InstallOtherApps

CORPORATE ADMINISTRATORS
=========================

- To be able to deploy Internet Explorer to users who do not have
  Administrator-level access, you should select "Enable user access
  log on after restart" on the User Experience page of the IEAK 
  Wizard. This option is available only to corporate administrators 
  when the package is built solely as a "flat" package--otherwise,
  this option is not enabled.

- If you enable User Rights Deployment, certain customizations will
  not be applied during setup for users without Administrator-level
  access on Windows 2000 and Windows NT4. These customizations must
  be deployed with Windows 2000 Group Policy or Windows NT4 Policy
  editor. More information is available at http://ieak.microsoft.com/.

- If you enable User Rights Deployment and select to install the
  Windows Desktop Update, users without Administrator-level access
  who log on after setup on Windows 2000 will see two errors 
  referring to shdoc401.dll. Neither error is harmful, and setup will
  continue after the user dismisses them. For information about 
  avoiding these errors, please consult http://ieak.microsoft.com/.

- When you are creating an SMS package from ie6-sms.sms and 
  distributing IEAK6 through SMS 2.0 or later, the wrong status may 
  appear. This happens because the status MIF file is being generated 
  with a wrong "VERSION=". The version in the MIF file is set to 55, 
  but the version in ie6-sms.sms is set to 6. To correct this problem,
  change all "VERSION=" parameters in ie6-sms.sms to 55 before 
  creating a package from it.

  >>>To install the Office 2000 Resource Kit on the same computer as
     IEAK 6, follow these instructions carefully:

     If you HAVE NOT installed IEAK 6, you must:
       1. Install the Office 2000 Resource Kit (it will install
          an older IEAK).
       2. Install IEAK 6 as an upgrade.

     If you HAVE already installed IEAK 6, you must:
       1. Uninstall IEAK 6.
       2. Install the Office 2000 Resource Kit (it will install
          an older IEAK).
       3. Reinstall the IEAK 6 as an upgrade.

- Custom Components selected to "Install After System Restart" will
  not install on Windows Terminal Server.

- If you are importing your current Active Desktop settings, turn on
  the Channel bar, and do not include channels. The installed package
  displays an empty Channel bar on the desktop.

- If you are distributing the Web Desktop Update on Windows NT 4.0
  workstations, and your users are not at the Administrator level, 
  you must use Policy Editor to manage the Web Desktop Update 
  restrictions. These restrictions are not applied during Internet 
  Explorer Setup or during automatic configuration. This is not an
  issue if your users are at the Administrator level.

- When you use the policy to allow controls only from trusted
  publishers, be aware that Internet Explorer Setup and automatic
  configuration with .cab files will not work if the .cab files are
  not signed and the publisher is not on the trusted publisher list. 
  Also, Automatic Install will not work when you use this policy.
