# The TARGETPATH and TARGETTYPE variables are defined by the developer.
# The first specifies where the target is to be build.  The second specifies
# the type of target (either PROGRAM, DYNLINK, LIBRARY, UMAPPL_NOLIB or

# apps and don't need to build a library.

#
# The SOURCES variable is defined by the developer.  It is a list of all the
