eudora pro and light (through v3.x) store file format

folder hierarchy information is stored in descmap.pce files. descmap.pce is
located in the root of the eudora store and in each subfolder directory.
each line in the descmap.pce file has information about a folder or
mailbox within that folder. (folders can contain folders or mailboxes but
no messages, and mailboxes can only contain messages.)
the format of the descmap.pce file:
<display name>,<file>,<type>,<?>
where <display name> = string
      <file> = directory for folder, or file for mailbox
      <type> = 'S' (special) | 'M' (mailbox) | 'F' (folder)
directory and file names are within current directory.

<filename>.mbx - message file
<filename>.toc - header file

message file:
contains messages as they are received from the wire.
each message starts with line "From - <day> <month> <date> <time> <year>"
where <day> = "Mon" | "Tue" | "Wed" | "Thu" | "Fri" | "Sat" | "Sun"
      <month> = "Jan" | "Feb" | "Mar" | "Apr" | "May" | "Jun" | "Jul" | "Aug" | "Sep" | "Oct" | "Nov" | "Dec"
      <date> = dd
      <time> = hh:mm:ss
      <year> = yyyy
for example,
From - Wed Mar 26 10:04:38 1997

header file:
contains cached header info and state information for messages in message file.
header file header structure:
104 bytes
0 - 30: first chars of folder name, NULL terminated (this may only be 28 chars)
31 - 101: ?
102 - 103: number of messages in the folder

following the header are the headers for the messages.

headers:
the headers are 218 bytes in length and are contiguous in the header file.
0 - 3: offset of message in message file
4 - 7: size of message in message file
8 - 11: ?
12: state (0 = unread, 1 = read, 2 = replied, 3 = forwarded,
           4 = redirected, 5 = unsendable, 6 = sendable,
           7 = queued, 8 = sent, 9 = unsent)
13 - 14: ?
15: more state (0x80 bit on if the message has attachment(s))
16: priority (1 = highest, 5 = lowest)
17 - 217: ?

attachments are removed from messages and stored to disk. for each attachment
that is removed, a placeholder is added to the message.
placeholder format:
Attachment Converted: "<file>"
where <file> = the full path of the location where the attachment is stored
               (the quotes are optional)
eudora doesn't handle long file names very well, so the path may be incorrect.

eudora doesn't handle multipart messages well. they leave the
"Content-Type: multipart" header in the message, but they tear out all of
the multipart boundaries.
