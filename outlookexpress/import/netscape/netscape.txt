netscape v2.0x and v3.0x store file format

<folder> - message file
<folder>.snm - header file

message file:
contains messages as they are received from the wire.
each message starts with line "From - <day> <month> <date> <time> <year>"
where <day> = "Mon" | "Tue" | "Wed" | "Thu" | "Fri" | "Sat" | "Sun"
      <month> = "Jan" | "Feb" | "Mar" | "Apr" | "May" | "Jun" | "Jul" | "Aug" | "Sep" | "Oct" | "Nov" | "Dec"
      <date> = dd
      <time> = hh:mm:ss
      <year> = yyyy
for example,
From - Wed Mar 26 10:04:38 1997

header file:
contains cached header info and state information for messages in message file.
since the headers for the messages aren't generated until the folder is opened,
the header file may have less headers than the message file has messages.
header file header structure:
59 bytes
0 - 24: "# Netscape folder cache\r\n"
41 - 44: number of headers in the header file
45 - 48: non-deleted messages in the folder file
57 - 58: number of strings in the string table + 1

following the header is a string table which the headers index. the strings are
variable length and are NULL terminated. to find the end of the string table count
through all of the strings. the string table begins with a NULL.

following the string table are the headers for the messages.

headers:
the headers are at least 30 bytes in length but can be longer. header begins
immediately after the preceding header.
0 - 1: string index
2 - 3: string index
4 - 5: string index
6 - 9: date?
10 - 12: state?
13: state (0x01 = read, 0x10 = newly downloaded?, 0x08 = deleted)
14 - 17: offset of message in message file
18 - 21: size of message in message file
22 - 25: ?
26 - 27: string index
28 - 29: count of additional string indeces which immediately follow
         (multiply this number times 2 to get additional size of header)
