Last Updated: 08/25/98 - SMAPI changes

Outlook's MAPISTUB is making a timid return to OE in time for Beta 2.

To avoid hosing IE self-hosters with our next drop (any more than they already are), we will only be installing it as part of mailnews.exe installs for a while.  If it tests well, we will move it to the core install.  In future, we will probably continue this practice - mailnews.exe installs will install a new version of the stub, and if all goes well we will move it over to the core install after a week.

If you are testing SMAPI, please do NOT check the SMAPI checkbox after you have installed as this will invalidate your results.  Also when you report SMAPI bugs, please include the mapistub.dll version number from Help | About.

Thanks.
