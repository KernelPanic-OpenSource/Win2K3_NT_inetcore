Module Name:

    sources.

Abstract:
    This file specifies the target component being built and the list of
    sources files needed to build that component.  Also specifies optional
    compiler switches and libraries that are unique for the component being
    built.

History:
    13-Oct-96 broken away from mailnews (t-erikne) (see below note)
    Created by Bryan Tuttle (bryant)
    from template created 12-Apr-1990 by Steve Wood (stevewo)

NOTE: Commented description of this file is in \nt\public\oak\bin\sources.tpl

. . . This is only loosly tied to mailnews, so it uses its own include line
and its own pch.  Expected to go away soon into mimeole.
